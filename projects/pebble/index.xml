      <description>Time Twist Pop is an simple, vibrant watchface design that aims to inject fun and colour into your day. With 24 different themes to choose from, you can easily switch up the look of the watchface to suit how you&amp;rsquo;re feeling.
Made during the Rebble Hackathon #001, Time Twist Pop is my first foray into programming, completed within 48 hours.
The Themes           The 24 themes each have their own feel and identity.</description>

      <description>The task Inspired by the Pebble revival project, Rebble and their unique aesthetic inspired by the original series of icons developed by Heydays design for pebble, I set out to make my own weather icons to use in projects on the watches in the future. While I took inspiration to make them familiar to users, I also sought to give them their own flair and personality.
  The original Pebble icons, designed by Heydays.</description>
