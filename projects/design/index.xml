      <description>The Virtual Gallery a website was born in the summer of 2020 after the cancellation of an exhibition that an art course I was attending hosted. Not wanting the work and effort of everyone I did the course with to go to waste, I set out to make a platform for them to share with their friends and family.
The Exhibition Work took several months to build a basic site from scratch using HTML and CSS, largely due to my inexperience however I learned a lot.</description>

      <description>Origami Modular Festive Tree The Origami festive tree is a modular origami tree with little slots in the leaves to put whatever you want! It was designed as a modular, flat-packable festive tree that could be practical, allowing you to put different decorations or items in it. The design still needs some tweaking before I&amp;rsquo;m happy with posting instructions, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably get around to it soon.
Origami Cat This is my take on the origami cat design, there isn&amp;rsquo;t too much to say about it, the design itself isn&amp;rsquo;t all too complicated.</description>
