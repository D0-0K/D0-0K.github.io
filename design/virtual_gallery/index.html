<p>The Virtual Gallery a website was born in the summer of 2020 after the cancellation of an exhibition that an art course I was attending hosted. Not wanting the work and effort of everyone I did the course with to go to waste, I set out to make a platform for them to share with their friends and family.</p>

<p>It took several months to build a basic site from scratch using HTML and CSS, largely due to my inexperience however I learned a lot. During this time the scope changed drastically, deciding to open it up to other young artists locally who wanted to share their work. In the end, 15 artists signed up to exhibit. Despite my inability to run proper social media for it, the exhibition was quite successful. While a follow-up photography competition was planned, circumstances preventing me from working on the site. I hope to pick the project back up from scratch in the future, however.</p>
