      <description>&lt;p&gt;Compacticons is an open-source symbolic icon set designed around a core limitation of 14x13 pixels and 28x13 pixels. This strict limitation came from a desire to create more compact user interfaces without obstructing the user&amp;rsquo;s ability to discern information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each icon is designed to be highly legible, with care put into pixel hinting for perfect results. This makes them great to use on devices of all resolutions. The current initial set of icons are designed for music based apps and systems, however the range of targetted usecases will be expanded over time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Completed in May 2023, this was a commission to create a complete logo package from a sketch provided by the client. A complimentary colourscheme for each style was provided, alongside an opensource terminal-style font that the client felt matched the vibe best.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;span&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;logo-visual-guide&#34;&gt;Logo Visual Guide&lt;/h2 id=&#34;logo-visual-guide&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#logo-visual-guide&#34; class=&#34;header_link&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 13.2 13.2&#34; height=&#34;21&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;m5.51 2.99 1.06-1.06a3.17 3.17 0 0 1 4.5-.004 3.187 3.187 0 0 1 0 4.5L10 7.496m-2.5 2.5-1.09 1.08a3.186 3.186 0 0 1-4.5-.001 3.19 3.19 0 0 1-.001-4.5l.585-.585M7.974 5l-3 3&#34; style=&#34;fill:none;stroke-linecap:round;stroke-width:2;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;img  src=&#34;https://d00k.net/img/design/Tindra_VIG.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;Visual Identity Guide for the client&#34;  &gt;</description>

      <guid>https://d00k.net/design/beryl_logo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2023 I was commissioned to create a Logo and branding design for the Beryl project. &lt;a href=&#34;https://thesam.zone/blog/beryl-todo/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Beryl&lt;/a&gt; is an open source, offline-first, markdown based Todo List system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For this project, I aimed the capture a clean and consistent feeling, to allow the project itself do the speaking. I was provided with the idea of a barrel in the style of the VLC logo, alongside a beautiful Beryl green colour from the project&amp;rsquo;s creator. Which from that I created the logo and a complimentary colourscheme that would work in the context of an app or website.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://d00k.net/design/themify/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Themify is a vibrant, user-customisable theme for Rockbox. The project&amp;rsquo;s UI design is completely original, built from the ground up around the iPod and it&amp;rsquo;s users. The goal was to create an inviting and intuitive user experience for iPods, while also catering to the new wave of users who wish to customise their iPods to suit themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first version came out in March of 2023, I view it more of a prototype to the finalised Themify 2 vision that will come out in 2025. The second version took over 2 years of work, pushing the limits of Rockbox and my project management skills.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Time Twist Pop is an simple, vibrant watchface design that aims to inject fun and colour into your day. With 24 different themes to choose from, you can easily switch up the look of the watchface to suit how you&amp;rsquo;re feeling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Made during the &lt;a href=&#34;https://rebble.io/hackathon-001/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Rebble Hackathon #001&lt;/a&gt;, Time Twist Pop was my first foray into programming, completed within 48 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;span&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-themes&#34;&gt;The Themes&lt;/h2 id=&#34;the-themes&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-themes&#34; class=&#34;header_link&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 13.2 13.2&#34; height=&#34;21&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;m5.51 2.99 1.06-1.06a3.17 3.17 0 0 1 4.5-.004 3.187 3.187 0 0 1 0 4.5L10 7.496m-2.5 2.5-1.09 1.08a3.186 3.186 0 0 1-4.5-.001 3.19 3.19 0 0 1-.001-4.5l.585-.585M7.974 5l-3 3&#34; style=&#34;fill:none;stroke-linecap:round;stroke-width:2;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;img  src=&#34;https://d00k.net/img/design/timetwistpop01.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;A poster of every theme option, with their colour and name&#34;  &gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;img  src=&#34;https://d00k.net/img/design/timetwistpop03.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;A poster of every pride theme option, with their colour and name&#34;  &gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The 24 themes each have their own feel and identity. Silver Shadow, Slate Shadow, Rose Quartz, Sailor Blue, Mint Twist, Strawberry Twist, Citrus Twist, Dragon Blue, Sorcerer Red and Purple Punch are the first series. There is also a second series of 14 Pride Flags. Background colours are dithered to create the illusion of a perfect blend, creating the watchface&amp;rsquo;s unique identity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Originally created in 2022, adwaitapod is a modern and feature-rich Ui theme for the iPod classic (5th generation onwards). Built using Rockbox, the theme is designed using the Gnome foundation&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adwaita_%28design_language%29&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Adwaita&lt;/a&gt; design language.

      <title>Rebble Weather Icons</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the Pebble revival project, Rebble, and their unique aesthetic inspired by the original series of icons developed by Heydays design for pebble, I set out to make my own weather icons to use in projects on the platform in the future. While I took inspiration to make them familiar to users, I also sought to give them their own flair and individual personality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://d00k.net/img/design/rebbleweather01.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;Many various icons for apps, weather and watch functions&#34;  &gt;&#xA;&lt;figcaption&gt;The original Pebble icons, designed by Heydays.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;span&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;rain-snow-and-clouds&#34;&gt;Rain, Snow and Clouds&lt;/h2 id=&#34;rain-snow-and-clouds&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#rain-snow-and-clouds&#34; class=&#34;header_link&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 13.2 13.2&#34; height=&#34;21&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;m5.51 2.99 1.06-1.06a3.17 3.17 0 0 1 4.5-.004 3.187 3.187 0 0 1 0 4.5L10 7.496m-2.5 2.5-1.09 1.08a3.186 3.186 0 0 1-4.5-.001 3.19 3.19 0 0 1-.001-4.5l.585-.585M7.974 5l-3 3&#34; style=&#34;fill:none;stroke-linecap:round;stroke-width:2;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;img  src=&#34;https://d00k.net/img/design/rebbleweather02.svg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;Different kinds of weather icons on a purple background. Example, snow, rain etc.&#34;  &gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The weather icons with clouds proved challenging at times, being limited to 3 angles (flat, 1:1 and 1:2) meant the shape was very limited in terms of originality and looking good. Eventually I took the cloud icon Lavender had made for the project, and jazzed it up making it more fluffy and rounder overall. There were many different prototypes designed before I landed on the final shape.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Streetwalker was a project started in 2016 in an attempt to learn lua and the pico-8 virtual console. After experiencing &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?pid=15930#p&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Graphics Exercise&lt;/a&gt; by Mason Lindroth, I was inspired to create my own walking sim with the goal of filling the system&amp;rsquo;s 1024x512 pixel map space.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;img  src=&#34;https://d00k.net/img/design/streetwalker_3.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;a large map of the game&amp;#39;s city&#34;  &gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The game&amp;rsquo;s design takes heavy inspiration from digital maps as well as brutalist architecture. Without any discernable differences from one place to the next, players are forced to wander and explore the world like they would with a new city. There are no gameplay objectives, however items are scattered randomly throughout the world. Attention was put into the physicality of the game&amp;rsquo;s world, with things like the character darkening when in shadows, large usable bridges that can be walked on and under as well as steps being slower to walk up and down.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Virtual Gallery a website was born in the summer of 2020 after the cancellation of an exhibition that an art course I was attending hosted. Not wanting the work and effort of everyone I did the course with to go to waste, I set out to make a platform for them to share with their friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;span&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-exhibition&#34;&gt;The Exhibition&lt;/h2 id=&#34;the-exhibition&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-exhibition&#34; class=&#34;header_link&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 13.2 13.2&#34; height=&#34;21&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;m5.51 2.99 1.06-1.06a3.17 3.17 0 0 1 4.5-.004 3.187 3.187 0 0 1 0 4.5L10 7.496m-2.5 2.5-1.09 1.08a3.186 3.186 0 0 1-4.5-.001 3.19 3.19 0 0 1-.001-4.5l.585-.585M7.974 5l-3 3&#34; style=&#34;fill:none;stroke-linecap:round;stroke-width:2;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;img  src=&#34;https://d00k.net/img/design/virtual_gallery_3.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;promotional poster from the exhibition title &amp;#39;Young Artists of Wexford&amp;#39;&#34;  &gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It took several months to build a basic site from scratch using HTML and CSS, largely due to my inexperience however I learned a lot. During this time the scope changed drastically, deciding to open it up to other young artists locally who wanted to share their work. In the end, 15 artists signed up to exhibit. Despite my inability to run proper social media for it, the exhibition was quite successful. While a follow-up photography competition was planned, circumstances preventing me from working on the site. I hope to pick the project back up from scratch in the future, however.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The goal of the jam was to make a small game that fit within the 10x11 resolution of the TV in the pico-8 cart provided. I entered the jam almost by accident, having no programming knowledge, I had messed around with the cart and designed a detailed recreation of a Macintosh 128k pc. I decided to make a game, Tiny Cookie Clicker, and the jam provided some great design challenges. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough space for full size numbers, so I had to come up with a 2x3 number font. This was achieved using two colours. The game can only count to 60 as I was unable to work out a proper display system, and instead resorted to hand coding every number.&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://d00k.net/img/projects/gamejam_3.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;numbers zero to ten from my sprite font&#34;  &gt;&#xA;&lt;figcaption&gt;The 2x3 font for Tiny Cookie Clicker&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
