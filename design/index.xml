      <description>Compacticons is an open-source symbolic icon set designed around a core limitation of 14x13 pixels and 28x13 pixels. This strict limitation came from a desire to create more compact user interfaces without obstructing the user&amp;rsquo;s ability to discern information.&#xA;Each icon is designed to be highly legible, with care put into pixel hinting for perfect results. This makes them great to use on devices of all resolutions. The current initial set of icons are designed for music based apps and systems, however the range of targetted usecases will be expanded over time.</description>

      <description>Inspired by the Pebble revival project, Rebble, and their unique aesthetic inspired by the original series of icons developed by Heydays design for pebble, I set out to make my own weather icons to use in projects on the platform in the future. While I took inspiration to make them familiar to users, I also sought to give them their own flair and individual personality.&#xA;The original Pebble icons, designed by Heydays.</description>

      <description>Streetwalker was a project started in 2016 in an attempt to learn lua and the pico-8 virtual console. After experiencing Graphics Exercise by Mason Lindroth, I was inspired to create my own walking sim with the goal of filling the system&amp;rsquo;s 1024x512 pixel map space.&#xA;The game&amp;rsquo;s design takes heavy inspiration from digital maps as well as brutalist architecture. Without any discernable differences from one place to the next, players are forced to wander and explore the world like they would with a new city.</description>

      <description>The Virtual Gallery a website was born in the summer of 2020 after the cancellation of an exhibition that an art course I was attending hosted. Not wanting the work and effort of everyone I did the course with to go to waste, I set out to make a platform for them to share with their friends and family.&#xA;The Exhibition It took several months to build a basic site from scratch using HTML and CSS, largely due to my inexperience however I learned a lot.</description>

      <description>Tiny-TV Jam Tiny-TV Jam ran for a week in January 2017. The goal of the jam was to make a small game that fit within the 10x11 resolution of the TV in the pico-8 cart provided. I entered the jam almost by accident, having no programming knowledge, I had messed around with the cart and designed a detailed recreation of a Macintosh 128k pc. I decided to make a game, Tiny Cookie Clicker, and the jam provided some great design challenges.</description>
