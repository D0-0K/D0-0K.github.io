    <p>If you can keep your head when all about you
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or being lied about, donâ€™t deal in lies,
Or being hated, donâ€™t give way to hating,
And yet donâ€™t look too good, nor talk too wise:</p>
<p>If you can dreamâ€”and not make dreams your master;
If you can thinkâ€”and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth youâ€™ve spoken
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
And stoop and build â€™em up with worn-out tools:</p>
<p>If you can make one heap of all your winnings
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
Except the Will which says to them: â€˜Hold on!â€™</p>
<p>If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
Or walk with Kingsâ€”nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
With sixty secondsâ€™ worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything thatâ€™s in it,
Andâ€”which is moreâ€”youâ€™ll be a Man, my son!</p>
