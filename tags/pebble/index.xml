      <description>The task Â The Pebble revival project, Rebble, has been branching out to make replacement apps and firmware for Pebbles to help with longevity. Part of this has included remaking icons as the original Pebble ones are not open source or legally usable. This page details the weather icons I designed for the project, and for use in my own watchfaces. They follow the same rules as the original icons, however have their own Rebble twist to them.</description>
