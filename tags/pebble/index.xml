      <description>The task Â Inspired by the Pebble revival project, Rebble and their unique aesthetic inspired by the original series of icons developed by Heydays design for pebble, I set out to make my own weather icons to use in projects on the watches in the future. While I took inspiration to make them familiar to users, I also sought to give them their own flair and personality.
  The original Pebble icons, designed by Heydays.</description>
