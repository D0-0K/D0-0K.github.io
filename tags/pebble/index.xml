      <description>Time Twist Pop is an simple, vibrant watchface design that aims to inject fun and colour into your day. With 9 different themes to choose from, you can easily switch up the look of the watchface to suit how you&amp;rsquo;re feeling.
 An ongoing project, Time Twist Pop is my first foray into working with C. Being a difficult language, especially for beginners, I intend to take my time to get it just right.</description>

      <description>The task  Inspired by the Pebble revival project, Rebble and their unique aesthetic inspired by the original series of icons developed by Heydays design for pebble, I set out to make my own weather icons to use in projects on the watches in the future. While I took inspiration to make them familiar to users, I also sought to give them their own flair and personality.
  The original Pebble icons, designed by Heydays.</description>
