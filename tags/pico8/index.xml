      <description>Pico-8 is a fantasy console for playing and making smol games. There has been a vibrant community surrounding the system for years, and some fantastic games have been produced during that time. This list is a compiled collection of my personal favourites, and games I consider to be some of the best on the system.
Time Wasters These games a short and quick to play, but an absolute blast whenever you want to waste some time or just chill!</description>
