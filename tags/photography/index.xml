      <description>Trichrome is a method of taking colour photography using different coloured filters (usually red, blue and green) to form a complete image. It was invented by Louis Ducos du Hauron in the late 19th century. It is most commonly used in black &amp;amp; white film photography to create atmospheric images, however the technique is usable with digital photography as well.
How does it work?  Shooting trichrome is quite simple, firstly you need lenses.</description>
