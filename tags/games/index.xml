      <description>Streetwalker was a project started in 2016 in an attempt to learn lua and the pico-8 virtual console. After experiencing Graphics Exercise by Mason Lindroth, I was inspired to create my own walking sim with the goal of filling the system&amp;rsquo;s 1024x512 pixel map space.
Â      The game&amp;rsquo;s design takes heavy inspiration from digital maps as well as the brutalist architecture movement.</description>

      <description>Tiny-TV Jam       Tiny-TV Jam ran for a week in January 2017. The goal of the jam was to make a small game that fit within the 10x11 resolution of the TV in the pico-8 cart provided. I entered the jam almost by accident, having no programming knowledge, I had messed around with the cart and designed a detailed recreation of a Macintosh 128k pc. I decided to make a game, Tiny Cookie Clicker, and the jam provided some great design challenges.</description>
