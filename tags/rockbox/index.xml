      <description>In recent years, there have been many developments in the rockbox theming space. New ways of abstracting the theme tags rockbox uses to customise it&amp;rsquo;s UI have been created to give users even more functionality and better themes than ever before. However, a lot of these tricks are not well documented and involve being quite familiar with how rockbox theming works in order to extrapolate their construction. This guide intends to be a collection of these tricks, how to make them, as well as discussing some newer or rarely-used tags in rockbox.</description>

      <description>Fontforge&amp;#39;s interface    Â This is a method of combining two different .ttf fonts into one. Useful for making CJK supported fonts for Rockbox, or adding glyphs into a font for web purposes etc. Fontforge is the main application used, however if you intend to make fonts for Rockbox, you&amp;rsquo;ll need convttf from their dev tools. This guide focuses on combining CJK fonts with non-CJK fonts.</description>
