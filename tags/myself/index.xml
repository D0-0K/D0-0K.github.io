      <description>At a glance, this year has been a bit of a writeoff for me. I was diagnosed with Crohn&amp;rsquo;s earlier in the year and I&amp;rsquo;ve spent most of the rest recovering, going so far to drop out of college on medical leave. My high risk to covid has left me isolating in my home for a large amount of time as well. Both have hampered my ability to do much physical things, but allowed me to read and research more than I could before.</description>
