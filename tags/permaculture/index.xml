The village, which spreads over 67 acres, houses an amphitheatre, a large community farm, the riot rye bakery, a hostel and even a lovely bookstore that specialises in permaculture, sustainable living and activism.
Â Village Characteristics      Cloughjordan Ecovillage has a large variety in housing, near the village entrance are a number of spacey apartment blocks surrounding the town square.</description>
