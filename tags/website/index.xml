      <description>A comprehensive dive into the design, creation and philosophy of this site.
Site Philosophy This site exists to scratch an itch I&amp;rsquo;ve long had. Sharing stuff on social media has never been my mojo, I&amp;rsquo;ll often post my photography, however I yearned for something more expansive and interesting, so I made a website.
The design of this site was made with one goal in mind: create vibrant a site that looks good and is fun to use, with the smallest file size possible.</description>
