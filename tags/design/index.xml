      <description>A comprehensive dive into the design, and creation of this website
 Background  This site was made to scratch an itch I long had. Sharing stuff on social media has never been my mojo, I&amp;rsquo;ll often post my photography, however I yearned for something more expansive and exciting so I made a website.
 The first version of the site was made by modifying what I felt was a suitable theme, however I soon became aware of my lack of knowledge in web design and development, scrapping the site soon after I finished it.</description>

      <description>The Virtual Gallery was born in the summer of 2020 after the cancellation of an exhibition that an art course I was attending hosted. Not wanting the work and effort of everyone I did the course with to go to waste, I set out to make a platform for them to share with their friends and family.
 The Exhibition      Work took several months to build a basic site from scratch using HTML and CSS, largely due to my inexperience however I learned a lot.</description>

      <description>Origami Modular Festive Tree      The Origami festive tree is a modular origami tree with little slots in the leaves to put whatever you want! It was designed as a modular, flat-packable festive tree that could be practical, allowing you to put different decorations or items in it. The design still needs some tweaking before I&amp;rsquo;m happy with posting instructions, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably get around to it soon.</description>
