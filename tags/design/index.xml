      <description>Time Twist Pop is an simple, vibrant watchface design that aims to inject fun and colour into your day. With 9 different themes to choose from, you can easily switch up the look of the watchface to suit how you&amp;rsquo;re feeling.
 An ongoing project, Time Twist Pop is my first foray into working with C. Being a difficult language, especially for beginners, I intend to take my time to get it just right.</description>

      <description>Over the past 10 months, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on and off tweaking my site to get it closer to how I want it to look and perform. The main goal was simple: make a site that looks good, and loads fast. A quick solution would&amp;rsquo;ve been to keep the css to a minimum, use browser defaults for fonts etc. However that would&amp;rsquo;ve made my vision of a styled site difficult if not impossible.</description>

      <description>The task  Inspired by the Pebble revival project, Rebble and their unique aesthetic inspired by the original series of icons developed by Heydays design for pebble, I set out to make my own weather icons to use in projects on the watches in the future. While I took inspiration to make them familiar to users, I also sought to give them their own flair and personality.

      <description>A comprehensive dive into the design, creation and philosophy of this site.
Site Philosophy  This site exists to scratch an itch I&amp;rsquo;ve long had. Sharing stuff on social media has never been my mojo, I&amp;rsquo;ll often post my photography, however I yearned for something more expansive and interesting, so I made a website.
 The design of this site was made with one goal in mind: create vibrant a site that looks good and is fun to use, with the smallest file size possible.</description>

      <description>The Virtual Gallery a website was born in the summer of 2020 after the cancellation of an exhibition that an art course I was attending hosted. Not wanting the work and effort of everyone I did the course with to go to waste, I set out to make a platform for them to share with their friends and family.
The Exhibition      Work took several months to build a basic site from scratch using HTML and CSS, largely due to my inexperience however I learned a lot.</description>

      <description>Origami Modular Festive Tree      The Origami festive tree is a modular origami tree with little slots in the leaves to put whatever you want! It was designed as a modular, flat-packable festive tree that could be practical, allowing you to put different decorations or items in it. The design still needs some tweaking before I&amp;rsquo;m happy with posting instructions, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably get around to it soon.</description>
