      <description>The Bridge into the House In the summer of 2018, I spent some time in the town of Westport in the west of Ireland. Staying near the bay, the docks as well Westport House were a short walk from where we stayed. The views never failed to disappoint, being at the foot of Croagh Patrick. My favourite memory from here is going off the main path in Westport House, following a dirt trail and coming across a gorgeous red bridge before a short waterfall.</description>

      <description> Dromineer Marina I spent a week around Lough Derg in March 2022. Staying in Dromineer, the village was host to a decently sized Marina, a castle ruins as well as a 10th century church. The area surrounding the lake are full of forest trails and castles galore. The roads in the locality are part of a larger cycling trail.
