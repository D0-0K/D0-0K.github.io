      <description>   Dromineer Marina    I spent a week around Lough Derg in March 2022. Staying in Dromineer, the village was host to a decently sized Marina, a castle ruins as well as a 10th century church. The area surrounding the lake are full of forest trails and castles galore. The roads in the locality are part of a larger cycling trail.
