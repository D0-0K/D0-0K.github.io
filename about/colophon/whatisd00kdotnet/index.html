<div class="title"><h1 id="top">What is d00k.net?</h1><hr></div>
<p>Created in 2021, d00k.net has been my home on the internet for over 3 years now. It&rsquo;s function and purpose has evolved during this time, ultimately coming to it&rsquo;s current state today. It&rsquo;s original purpose was to help understand myself better by placing all the knowledge I knew and all the art I created in one spot, and it still retains this purpose today. However, it has also evolved along with my own design practices to represent my standings on how unsustainable the technology industry is and how it forces us to consume at obscene rates.</p>
<hr>

<h2 id="this-site-runs-on-everything">This site runs on everything.</h2><p>Admittedly a hyberbolic phrase, however it is founded in truth. In 2023, I rebuilt the entire website from scratch with a singular goal: make it run on every tech device I own. This was no easy task, almost every website today fails to work on devices with web browsers over 4 or 5 years old. Finding a website that loads as-designed on a browser over 10-12 years old is almost impossible.  Web browsers have evolved so much in the past decade, but it presents two issues:</p>
<p><strong>1.)</strong> Companies have stopped updating devices to force users to buy new ones, leaving hundreds of millions of devices with outdated browsers.</p>
<p><strong>2.)</strong> Websites have become more and more resource intensive to load and older, &lsquo;slower&rsquo; devices struggle immensely loading modern websites.</p>
<p>There are some people who make websites the &lsquo;old&rsquo; way, like retro-technology enthusiasts or sustainability focused technologists, however these websites were most commonly designed in an extremely basic manner. My desire with the redesign was to overcome this perceived design limitation and create a visually modern website that was fast, sustainable and could run on every single device I have ever owned.</p>
<p>I recommend trying it out, grab an old device you have and try load this website! I&rsquo;ve tested it as far back as my first phone, the Nokia C3 with ran Opera Mini.</p>
