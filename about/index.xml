      <description>A comprehensive dive into the design, and creation of this website
Background  This site was made to scratch an itch I long had. Sharing stuff on social media has never been my mojo, I&amp;rsquo;ll often post my photography, however I yearned for something more expansive and exciting so I made a website.
 The first version of the site was made by modifying what I felt was a suitable theme, however I soon became aware of my lack of knowledge in web design and development, scrapping the site soon after I finished it.</description>

      <description>A breakdown of the hardware and software I use for making things, or getting things done.
Hardware    Keychron C1 Keyboard    ∘ Lenovo Thinkpad E580 Laptop. Cpu - Intel Core I5-8250U Memory - 12GB Storage - 256GB Samsung SSD Display - 1920x1080 LCD OS - Fedora Linux  ∘ Keychron C1 Wired Keyboard. The Keychron C1 is an 85%, Tenkeyless wired mechanical Keyboard. I bought it mostly for it&amp;rsquo;s low price, as well for it&amp;rsquo;s lack of wireless and light-up features.</description>
