      <description>Currently listening to • Various Studio Ghibli soundtracks by Joe Hisaihi.
• Dreamgirl, for some lo fi vibes.
• Citypop compilations from Youtube.
 Music Notes Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m beginning a journey to move away from Spotify. I&amp;rsquo;ve begun buying an album a month on Bandcamp, as well as buying CDs when I can (second hand stores are great). I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to purchase an iPod Classic for portable music, it might become a project as well to add some mods like flash storage.</description>

      <description>A comprehensive dive into the design, and creation of this website
 Background  This site was made to scratch an itch I long had. Sharing stuff on social media has never been my mojo, I&amp;rsquo;ll often post my photography, however I yearned for something more expansive and exciting so I made a website.
 The first version of the site was made by modifying what I felt was a suitable theme, however I soon became aware of my lack of knowledge in web design and development, scrapping the site soon after I finished it.</description>
