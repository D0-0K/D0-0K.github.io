      <description>A comprehensive dive into the design, creation and philosophy of this site.
Site Philosophy This site exists to scratch an itch I&amp;rsquo;ve long had. Sharing stuff on social media has never been my mojo, I&amp;rsquo;ll often post my photography, however I yearned for something more expansive and interesting, so I made a website.
The design of this site was made with one goal in mind: create vibrant a site that looks good and is fun to use, with the smallest file size possible.</description>

      <description>A short breakdown of my setup, the hardware and software I use for creating and doing everyday work.
Hardware Keychron C1 Keyboard ∘ Lenovo Thinkpad E580 Laptop. - Going on 5 years old now, this was relatively cheap at the time for what it provided. Over the years I&amp;rsquo;ve upgraded it with an SSD, more ram and so on. In 2021, I switched to using Fedora Linux from Windows and it&amp;rsquo;s been an incredibly smooth experience.</description>
