      <description>A comprehensive dive into the design, creation and philosophy of this site.
Site Philosophy  This site exists to scratch an itch I&amp;rsquo;ve long had. Sharing stuff on social media has never been my mojo, I&amp;rsquo;ll often post my photography, however I yearned for something more expansive and interesting, so I made a website.
 The design of this site was made with one goal in mind: create vibrant a site that looks good and is fun to use, with the smallest file size possible.</description>

      <description>A breakdown of the hardware and software I use for making things, or getting things done.
Hardware    Keychron C1 Keyboard    ∘ Lenovo Thinkpad E580 Laptop. Cpu - Intel Core I5-8250U Memory - 12GB Storage - 256GB Samsung SSD Display - 1920x1080 LCD OS - Fedora Linux  ∘ Keychron C1 Wired Keyboard. The Keychron C1 is an 85%, Tenkeyless wired mechanical Keyboard. I bought it mostly for it&amp;rsquo;s low price, as well for it&amp;rsquo;s lack of wireless and light-up features.</description>
