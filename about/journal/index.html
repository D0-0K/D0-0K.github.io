<h2>2023-09-30 - September Update</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a while, huh? I had been intending to update this every month this year, but unfortunately life had other ideas and I got fairly busy.</p>
<p>Some major projects have been completed during the summer. <a href="/design/adwaitapod/">Adwaitapod 3.0</a> was released, and is now pretty much stable and bug-free. This update has really brought the project to where I envisioned it from the start, and brings so much to the table for iPods. I pushed the limits of what Rockbox&rsquo;s theming engine can do, which was difficult, but the results have been worth it. I still have a promo push I want to do for this project, with a friend of mine making up a small trailer for it, and a dedicated website ready to go alongside it. I want to experiment with doing publicity for my themes, hopefully it can save a few more devices from landfill.</p>
<p>After that, I got to redesigning and rebuilding my website. A massive undertaking, with a goal to make it more efficient and better designed. It&rsquo;s also now the smallest it&rsquo;s ever been, with the homepage sitting at a tiny 43kB (which includes fonts <em>and</em> a png image!). The css file is 3.33kB, which I&rsquo;m really proud of since I managed to cram so much into it. The wiki has been massively expanded, and now is a lot better organised. There&rsquo;s been a bunch of big changes, I really recommend checking it all out and also <a href="/blog/redesigning_again/">reading the blog post about it!</a></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a bunch more stuff completed this summer, but things will also be slowing down a lot now sadly. I recently started back up in college after a two year break, I&rsquo;m now doing a bachelor of arts in Interaction Design, something that is far more catered towards my interests and focuses with design as a tool. It&rsquo;s pretty full on, so my free time is practically non-existent now which is disappointing. But I aim to slowly get to work on stuff when I can!</p>
<p>Until next time, whenever that may be - Dook</p>

<h2>2023-04-30 - April Update</h2>
<p>What a fast month! It&rsquo;s hard to believe it&rsquo;s already the end of April. I haven&rsquo;t been working on too many projects this month, but the ones I have been working on were pretty important.</p>
<p>The biggest project this month has been the next update to my iPod UI project: <a href="https://d00k.net/projects/ipod/adwaitapod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adwaitapod</a>. This has been a major undertaking, rewriting the entire thing from scratch. But it&rsquo;s been worthwhile. The massive gains made with compression, efficiency and so on have made enough room to add a wide range of new features and still come in smaller than the last version of adwaitapod. I took the chance to take a proper design-orientated approach, rather than simply copying the GNOME desktop design, I used their principles to interpret the user experience of an iPod and make it as user friendly as possible. I&rsquo;m immensely happy with the results so far. The last few things to do involve writing documentation and creating some promo materials, which I&rsquo;ve commissioned a friend to help with. All things going well, adwaitapod 3.0 should be out next month!</p>
<p>I also completed my first paid work this month! I reached out to <a href="https://thesam.zone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sam</a> on fedi after they made a post looking for a designer to make a logo for their project <a href="https://thesam.zone/blog/beryl-todo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beyrl</a>. I was mostly interested in using it as a chance to gain experience working with a client and designing icons/branding, but we were both very happy with the results! I&rsquo;ll put together a proper page for this project after I deliver the end product.</p>
<p>A major milestone this month was the submission of my final college portfolio. I&rsquo;m still looking to complete my degree in Design, so hopefully by this September I&rsquo;ll be back in college again.</p>
<p>Lastly, some small changes and updates to the site this month. The colourscheme was changed slightly to be less yellow, and improve reading contrast. I also updated the Bee Encyclopedia with the newly captured <a href="/knowledge/bees/#early-mining-bee">Early Mining Bee</a>, we&rsquo;re in peak bee season right now so I&rsquo;m hoping to capture some more species that I haven&rsquo;t managed to yet!</p>
<p>Things have been slowing down (thankfully) but hopefully sometime next month I&rsquo;ll begin my migration over to a better SSG, I also have a few websites to design and build for friends over the summer that I&rsquo;m very much looking forward to! Till next month - Dook.</p>

<h2>2023-03-31 - March Update</h2>
<p>I think this month has been one of my most productive in a really long time! A good chunk of time was spent completing and releasing my latest UI theme for Rockbox, <a href="https://d00k.net/projects/ipod/themify/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Themify</a>. It&rsquo;s so far been received incredibly well, and has even reached my own goal of using design to convince people to use old devices.</p>
<p>Once I finished Themify, I set my eyes on the original UI theme I made called <a href="https://d00k.net/projects/ipod/adwaitapod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adwaitapod</a>, based on GNOME&rsquo;s design principals. I decided to remake it entirely from scratch, since I&rsquo;d learned so much in the last year that it was just easier to rewrite it all. This time I approached everything much smarter, the new version is about 65% smaller while having new features and performing much better. I just need to focus on some font issues in the github repo, fix a few bugs and work on the dark theme and then I can release it to the world!</p>
<p>Alongside everything else, I was approached recently to design an original user interface for a project. I&rsquo;ve spent some time creating an icon set, which I plan to open source soon, as well as brainstorming other parts of the interface. I haven&rsquo;t had a chance yet to design on a proper scale like this, so it&rsquo;s been very exciting and interesting having free reign as the sole designer on this part.</p>
<p>Lastly, my website turned a year old in March! I put together a <a href="https://d00k.net/journal/one-year-of-dook-net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> where I discussed how the site came to be, as well as the changes it went through during the year. I also took the last paragraph to think about where I want to website to go next, something I hope to work on really soon!</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for now, I have another 2 weeks to cram some projects in before I need to finish my final portfolio for college entry. Once that&rsquo;s done I plan on taking a break for the rest of the month to refresh and get ready for the rest of the year. Till then! - Dook.</p>

<h2>2023-02-28 - February Update</h2>
<p>Spent the first week of this month completing my portfolio for college entry, but in-between made some big improvements to the site. I simplified the inline links style to be far more visible than they were before, which also led to my stand-alone font for links becoming unnecessary. Getting rid of it has made my home page even smaller now, to just over 30kb.</p>
<p>After that, I began to work on a new iPod theme called Themify. I made it mostly to showcase some features of Rockbox I found that would let users fully customise the UI&rsquo;s colourscheme. The beta was shared on my Ko-Fi <a href="https://ko-fi.com/s/ec908b61b4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, and some people have shown support which has been really nice. At the same time, I&rsquo;ve been working on a commission I received to port a previous Rockbox theme of mine to a touch-screen device which has been a lot of fun.</p>
<p>This month I also started learning a few different programming languages including Uxntal, Python and bits of GTK for making a desktop app. I started learning Uxntal after getting an idea for a virtual pet synthesizer in a dream, so far compudanzas&rsquo; <a href="https://compudanzas.net/introduction_to_uxn_programming_book.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uxn book</a> has been extremely useful and makes uxn appear quite inviting, even as a relative beginner with programming. On the other hand GTK has been a nightmare to figure out, but I seem to make progress in big leaps at once. It&rsquo;s been quite enjoyable working on apps and software that I want or need.</p>
<p>Hopefully by the end of March I should have an update with a bunch of finished projects!</p>

<h2>2023-01-31 - January Update</h2>
<p>Happy new year! I&rsquo;ve decided this year to use my short journal as a more detailed monthly record. This month was largely focused on my college application. I&rsquo;m attempting to return to college in September, switching institutions as I do so to be closer to home. This requires a whole new application, portfolio etc which I spent most of this month handling. In my off time I put a decent amount of work into my website, solidifying parts of the website that have been disjointed up until now. I also started a <a href="/knowledge/linux">Linux Wiki</a> of various cheatsheets I&rsquo;ve written over the past year. These were received quite well, and I hope this knowledge will help others learn too. Lastly, this month I was shortlisted and exhibited in The Photographer&rsquo;s Gallery&rsquo;s <a href="https://unthinking.photography/commissions/small-file-photo-festival" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Small File Photo Festival</a>. I&rsquo;m very proud of this exhibition, combining two of my interests: Photography and Image Compression. I&rsquo;m hoping this year I&rsquo;ll be able to move about more and take photos again.</p>

<h2>2022-11-25 - November Update</h2>
<p>What a wild month! I started the month updating a finishing off my <a href="https://d00k.net/projects/adwaitapod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adwaitapod</a> theme for rockbox. I also spent the past 3 weeks learning to program in C, building up to the Rebble Hackathon last weekend where I put together my watchface design, <a href="https://d00k.net/projects/pebble/timetwistpop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Time Twist Pop</a> and released it! It was incredibly frustrating at times, since I really have very little experience programming. However, by the end of the weekend I was getting into the zone and pumping out some really good stuff and was having a blast! Really looking forward to making more with C in the future!</p>

<h2>2022-10-09 - Autumn Update</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s a crazy couple of months for me, but I finally found some time to tend to the website. First thing I did was get to finalising it&rsquo;s design, the way it had been before was overly garish and pretty difficult to look at on some pages, the new style is far better in this regard. I also took the time to go absolutely overboard on optimising every possible thing I could, making each pretty tiny for what it is, I made a writeup on everything I did <a href="https://d00k.net/journal/web-optimisations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>I also managed to find a new home on mastodon during this time at Lurk! It&rsquo;s a great community. A few new projects have been started as well; an accessible version of my ipod them after some user feedback, as well as a book for other people looking into making their own themes. Currently everything I&rsquo;m doing is building up for my portfolio to switch colleges with next year, so I&rsquo;m gonna be busy for the the next few months!</p>
