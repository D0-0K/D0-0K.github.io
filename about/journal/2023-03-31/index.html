<div class="title"><h1 id="top">March Update</h1><hr></div>
<p>I think this month has been one of my most productive in a really long time! A good chunk of time was spent completing and releasing my latest UI theme for Rockbox, <a href="https://d00k.net/projects/ipod/themify/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Themify</a>. It&rsquo;s so far been received incredibly well, and has even reached my own goal of using design to convince people to use old devices.</p>
<p>Once I finished Themify, I set my eyes on the original UI theme I made called <a href="https://d00k.net/projects/ipod/adwaitapod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adwaitapod</a>, based on GNOME&rsquo;s design principals. I decided to remake it entirely from scratch, since I&rsquo;d learned so much in the last year that it was just easier to rewrite it all. This time I approached everything much smarter, the new version is about 65% smaller while having new features and performing much better. I just need to focus on some font issues in the github repo, fix a few bugs and work on the dark theme and then I can release it to the world!</p>
<p>Alongside everything else, I was approached recently to design an original user interface for a project. I&rsquo;ve spent some time creating an icon set, which I plan to open source soon, as well as brainstorming other parts of the interface. I haven&rsquo;t had a chance yet to design on a proper scale like this, so it&rsquo;s been very exciting and interesting having free reign as the sole designer on this part.</p>
<p>Lastly, my website turned a year old in March! I put together a <a href="https://d00k.net/journal/one-year-of-dook-net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> where I discussed how the site came to be, as well as the changes it went through during the year. I also took the last paragraph to think about where I want to website to go next, something I hope to work on really soon!</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for now, I have another 2 weeks to cram some projects in before I need to finish my final portfolio for college entry. Once that&rsquo;s done I plan on taking a break for the rest of the month to refresh and get ready for the rest of the year. Till then! - Dook.</p>
