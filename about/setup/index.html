<p>A short breakdown of my setup, the hardware and software I use for creating and doing everyday work.</p>

<img class="highlight" src="/img/about/setup_keyboard.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="A grey and creamy white keyboard">


<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2><p>I have a variety of hardware in setup. All run open software/operating systems if possible. My laptop is running Fedora Linux since 2021, though it can be booted into Windows off a second hard drive if necessary. My Pixel 3a is running Lineage OS and my Kobo is running koreader. I run Rockbox on my iPod, with custom themes developed by myself like <a href="http://localhost:1313/design/adwaitapod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adwaitapod</a> and <a href="http://localhost:1313/design/themify/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">themify</a>.</p>

<h3 id="audio">Audio</h3><p>I have a largely salvaged/donated audio setup I put together from folks who were throwing stuff out. My amplifier is a second-hand purchase on ebay, the same with my iPod. My iPod is modified with larger, flash based storage, a bigger battery and a haptic feedback motor in place of the piezo speaker. My music collection is a mixture of CDs and digital downloads from Bandcamp or ripped albums.</p>

<h3 id="cameras">Cameras</h3><p>The Sony alpha 6000 is my main camera used for photography. I picked this mainly for it&rsquo;s mirrorless, lightweight build. It has many features I&rsquo;ve taken advantage of over the years, like it&rsquo;s remote control app which is fantastic for long exposures with a tripod. I never shoot in RAW, only basic file formats as I don&rsquo;t massively edit the complete photos in a conventional way, which you can read more about in my <a href="/wiki/trichrome">Trichrome</a> post.</p>
<p>My second camera is a Sony DSC-S85 from 2001 which I got second-hand on ebay. It&rsquo;s a capable camera, and produces surprisingly good shots for it&rsquo;s age. It also has some nice features, like a small reflective LCD that shows settings when you turn off the main LCD. It also has a GIF shooting mode which is coo lto mess around with. You can see some of the shots taken with it in the <a href="/gallery/digicam/sunsets">Digicam Gallery</a>.</p>

<img class="highlight" src="/img/about/setup3.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="A screenshot of two text editors on my desktop">


<h2 id="software">Software</h2><p>I use a wide range of software in my day to day, this here is only a small selection of my toolbox.</p>
<div class="text borderless box">

<div>
<h3 id="image-editors">Image Editors</h3><p><strong>∘ Inkscape</strong> - Inkscape is one of the main workhorse apps on my desktop. For icon creation, design mockups and even presentations. I&rsquo;m quite comfortable with it.</p>
<p><strong>∘ Krita</strong> - I actually use Krita to &lsquo;develop&rsquo; my trichrome photos. It has a great range of blending modes, which I use extensively.</p>
<p><strong>∘ Gimp</strong> - GIMP is extremely handy for what I do, and I often use it to compress and prep images for use in projects with a level of fine control that can be hard to get with ImageMagick.</p>
<p><strong>∘ ImageMagick</strong> - Used from the command line, ImageMagick&rsquo;s level of automation is fantastic. You can edit full directories of photos in a single command. I&rsquo;ve written up my cheatsheet <a href="/wiki/linux/imagemagick/">here</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="text borderless box">

<div>
<h3 id="text-editors">Text Editors</h3><p><strong>∘ GNOME Text Editor</strong> - I&rsquo;ve been using the default text editor in GNOME for quite a bit now. It&rsquo;s very simple and clean, when I&rsquo;m working on projects like my iPod themes for example it&rsquo;s great to be able to just focus on what I&rsquo;m typing.</p>
<p><strong>∘ Sublime Text</strong> - Sublime Text has become my go-to for more complex programming, mostly because I&rsquo;ve used it a lot in the past. I installed extras which enable colour previews and some better themes.</p>
<p><strong>∘ Apostrophe</strong> - A simple Markdown editor that I use for writing posts. Looking forward to the new version coming out soon.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="text borderless box">

<div>
<h3 id="other-software">Other Software</h3><p><strong>∘ Rad Reader</strong> - Developed by the great <a href="https://cblgh.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alexander cobleigh</a>, Rad Reader as quickly become my go-to RSS Feed Organiser. It&rsquo;s simplicity, paired with it&rsquo;s great design make it a breeze to use. My favourite part is easily the grouping of sites.</p>
<p><strong>∘ chat.sr.ht</strong> - I recently started using sourcehut&rsquo;s IRC Bouncer/Client so I could be more active in the IRC space. My previous native clients weren&rsquo;t great.</p>
