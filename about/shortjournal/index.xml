      <description>Happy new year! I&amp;rsquo;ve decided this year to use my short journal as a more detailed monthly record. This month was largely focused on my college application. I&amp;rsquo;m attempting to return to college in September, switching institutions as I do so to be closer to home. This requires a whole new application, portfolio etc which I spent most of this month handling. In my off time I put a decent amount of work into my website, solidifying parts of the website that have been disjointed up until now.</description>

      <description>What a wild month! I started the month updating a finishing off my adwaitapod theme for rockbox. I also spent the past 3 weeks learning to program in C, building up to the Rebble Hackathon last weekend where I put together my watchface design, Time Twist Pop and released it! It was incredibly frustrating at times, since I really have very little experience programming. However, by the end of the weekend I was getting into the zone and pumping out some really good stuff and was having a blast!</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a crazy couple of months for me, but I finally found some time to tend to the website. First thing I did was get to finalising it&amp;rsquo;s design, the way it had been before was overly garish and pretty difficult to look at on some pages, the new style is far better in this regard. I also took the time to go absolutely overboard on optimising every possible thing I could, making each pretty tiny for what it is, I made a writeup on everything I did here.</description>

      <description>My productivity has been hampered the past few weeks by illness, but I&amp;rsquo;ve slowly started to get back into my projects by improving my website. Shaved off a few hundred Mbs with favicon and other image optimisations, which I&amp;rsquo;m really happy with. I&amp;rsquo;ve also started to look for a new home server on Mastodon, my current server is shutting down for a 2 month rebuild and restart so I took it as a signal to finally find somewhere better.</description>

      <description>Without even realising it, I went on a bit of an internet detox this weekend. My phone&amp;rsquo;s gone almost 50 hours on a single charge, which is pretty good. I spent most of the weekend between working on some new design projects and watching the wildlife in our garden. It&amp;rsquo;s really become a sanctuary for so many different kinds of species, I even found a threatened leaf-cutter bee building a nest which was amazing to watch.</description>

      <description>Had some really hot weather today, spent most of the day in and out between the garden and my laptop. Started work designing a typeface for pebble watches based on their icon style. Looking to convert it into a watchface soon.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten interested this week in propagating seeds from wildflowers in our garden. There&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful pink poppy with massive seed pods, as well as a bunch of bluebells that I&amp;rsquo;d love to spread to other places. I was considering drying and saving the seed, following this guide from realseeds, however I don&amp;rsquo;t think there&amp;rsquo;s much reason to in this situation.</description>

      <description>Felt inspired to create a short form journal for the site after seeing some people on Mastodon doing the same. Excited to write more in it, hopefully this will also encourage me to update the site more! :3</description>
