<div class="title"><h1 id="top">Year Review 2023</h1><hr></div>
<p>It&rsquo;s that time of year again! Kind of incredible in a way, it doesn&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s been that long since I wrote last year&rsquo;s review. And what a crazy year it&rsquo;s been, despite a lot of chaos and changes I feel incredibly accomplished with what I managed to achieve and create over the past 12 months.</p>
<p>The past couple of years have been marked by bad health for me, and thankfully I&rsquo;ve felt pretty good and have been on the mend in 2023. Surprisingly, this was actually one of the only goals for this year that I got to! I was so intensely focused on design and programming this year that I never got around to working on art, unfortunately there wasn&rsquo;t a Rebble Hackathon this year so I never got around to making more watchfaces for my pebble.</p>
<p>I did however manage to make a very strong portfolio of work for college, and got an offer to study Interaction Design (originally I intended to study Product Design) I started studying in September, and despite the high amount of work and stress, I&rsquo;ve been having a blast. Unfortunately this took a hit to my free time, which put a halt on personal projects, but hopefully this should get better next year.</p>
<p>With that, lets take a look over everything I did in 2023, as well as some of my favourite things from the year!</p>
<hr>

<h2 id="changes">Changes</h2><p>Compared to the past few years, the changes to my setup have been pretty minimal this year. I think I&rsquo;m finally settling into the hardware and software that suits me best which makes me pretty happy to see.</p>

<h3 id="audio-hardware">Audio Hardware</h3>
<img  src="/img/blog/speakers.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Two sony speakers with an amplifier under them">

<p>The biggest changes to my setup this year were on the audio end. During the summer, I was contacted by someone who was throwing some stuff out and wondered if I wanted a pair of speakers. I said yes before I even saw them, but damn are they gorgeous. They needed a bit of repair to the speaker cone, and are a little grubby, but all in all sound so good.</p>
<p>I decided to treat myself a little a spent 100 euro on a second-hand Yamaha amplifier on ebay to power them, and it&rsquo;s easily the best purchase of the year. It sounds great, paired with it&rsquo;s gorgeous design it&rsquo;s so fun to have in my workstation. I have it hooked up to my laptop, iPod as well as some loose aux cables that lets me hook my phone or other things into it.</p>

<h3 id="ipod-upgrade">iPod Upgrade</h3><p>After having the parts for a year and a half, I finally modded my iPod replacing the dying battery and adding flash storage. While I was at it I also added a haptic feedback module from an iPhone to replace the click piezo speaker, though this mod was a little unsuccessful as I didn&rsquo;t use a good glue for the job. This has made my iPod actually useful, though I&rsquo;ve yet to switch to fully using it day to day.</p>

<h3 id="new-camera">New Camera</h3>
<img  src="/img/blog/dscs85.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="A grey camera with a large lens">

<p>A fun purchase this year was a Sony DSC-S85 digital camera from 2001! I&rsquo;ve been interested in Sony&rsquo;s floppy-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Mavica" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mavica</a> camera line for a while, and I was in the market for a cheap yet fun camera for travelling. The Mavicas were a candidate, however I was apprehensive about the maintenance required by a disc drive in the long run. That&rsquo;s when I stumbled across the parallel line of cameras Sony produced which used Memory Stick media instead, and knew immediately that I should get one.</p>
<p>I ended up purchasing mine on ebay for about 30 euro off an older man, it came with it&rsquo;s complete box and even a travel bag! And let me tell you, the camera is such a blast to use. The photos are surprisingly high quality, and you have a large amount of control over focus. It can even shot GIFs and video!</p>

<h2 id="favourite-things">Favourite Things</h2><p>It&rsquo;s been a bit of a bad year for content for me. I didn&rsquo;t engage much with manga or games like I have in other years, it&rsquo;s been a bit of a bad habit of mine to focus on personal projects instead of just relaxing. It has however been a good music year for me, I&rsquo;ve discovered some incredible music and also expanded my tastes a lot more. I also watched a lot more movies this year, as well as rewatched some of favourite older series like Adventure Time.</p>
<div class="text borderless box">

<div><h3 id="music">Music</h3><p><strong>∘ Favourite Artist &amp; Album - Hozier, Unreal Unearth</strong> - It&rsquo;s been an incredible year for Hozier. His third album, <em>Unreal Unearth</em>, launched this August to immediate success. The album is largely inspired by Dante&rsquo;s Inferno, with songs directly referencing parts of the iconic poem. Arguably it&rsquo;s Hozier at his best, with a clear and focused emotional narrative that follows through the album from start to finish. Executed to perfection with a high level of polish, it&rsquo;s a massive achievement for him. I recently saw one of his last shows on this year&rsquo;s leg of the tour, and it was just as incredible live. If you can, listen to the entire album in one sitting!</p></div>
</div>
<div class="text borderless box">

<div><h3 id="manga">Manga</h3><p><strong>∘ Red Cat Ramen</strong> - I&rsquo;ve read basically no manga this year, I think I burned out that motivation last year, but the one exception has been <em>Red Cat Ramen</em>. A new serial that started this year on Jump&rsquo;s online platform, the manga follows a Ramen shop ran entirely by cats and the human they just employed to help out with tasks they cannot do. It&rsquo;s a novel and enjoyable slice of life series that takes it slow and keeps things wholesome. Already slated for an anime adaptation for 2024, I highly recommend checking it out if you like manga!</p></div>

<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2><p>A lot of time on personal projects this year was spent honing skills I picked up in 2022. I did however dip my toes into some new things like writing GTK apps for Linux, and creating an icon system from scratch. I also began to do logo commissions, which was a great learning experience and helped my skills to grow a lot this year. You can check out the full project list from this year in the <a href="/design/#2023">design section of my site</a>.</p>
<div class="text borderless box">

<div><h3 id="website-redesign">Website Redesign</h3><p>My massive summer project and something I did not expect to do this year, I spent two months rebuilding and redesigning my site from the ground up. This was definitely a necessary project, and it&rsquo;s left me with a far better website than I had before. A massive part of this redesign was making it fully functional on older browsers, something which I&rsquo;ll cover in a new blogpost in the new year. If you&rsquo;re interested in the changes made though, have a look at my previous post: <a href="/blog/redesigning_again/">Re-designing my site, one more time</a></p></div>
</div>
<div class="text borderless box">

<div><h3 id="adwaitapod">Adwaitapod</h3><p>Easily my biggest piece of work to date, adwaitapod&rsquo;s rebuild this year was a monumentous undertaking. I set out to update my original iPod theme to be far more performant, better designed and crammed full with even more features than before. The resulting theme has been a massive success, recently crossing 18 and a half thousand downloads and amassing a fantastic userbase. I&rsquo;m incredibly proud of what I&rsquo;ve achieved with adwaitapod this year, and hope to take that energy forward to more iPod projects next year.</p></div>

<div class="text borderless box">

<div><h3 id="beryl-logo-design">Beryl Logo Design</h3><p>In May I reached out to <a href="https://thesam.zone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sam</a> on fedi after seeing his post looking for someone to help design a logo for his new markdown-based to-do list software called Beryl. After some chatting, we had a clear vision for what the logo should look like and following ideation and experimentation we settled on a design we both liked a lot. It&rsquo;s going to be an exciting year for the Beryl project, and I can&rsquo;t help but be proud to see the logo! I highly recommend checking out the <a href="https://beryl.md/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">project&rsquo;s site</a>!</p></div>

<h3 id="looking-towards-2024">Looking towards 2024</h3><p>This coming year I&rsquo;d like to focus on honing the skills I have a lot more. <a href="/design/themify">Themify&rsquo;s</a> next update is deep in development already, and is shaping up to be a project which will define the year for me. I&rsquo;m working with some friends on some exciting new ventures outside of my online life, which I think will help push me as a designer and help me realise my path a bit better. I also hope to travel a lot more next year, and have some exciting trips planned already!</p>
<p>Another thing I&rsquo;d like to do is to use this site more, I started more than a few blog posts the past few months but have a habit of making them incredibly long. Expect a lot more short blog posts going forward!</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>All in all, it&rsquo;s been a rollercoaster of a year. I&rsquo;ve achieved a heck of a lot and looking forward to doing even more next year. Here&rsquo;s to next year!</p>
