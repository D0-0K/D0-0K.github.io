<div class="title"><h1 id="top">On the Endless Web: My Relationship with the Internet</h1><hr></div>
<p>By chance, I&rsquo;ve had a lot of things recently in my life leading me to think about my relationship with the internet. 82MHz&rsquo;s blog post on his <a href="https://82mhz.net/posts/2023/09/my-relationship-with-digital-communication-the-beginnings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relationship with digital communication</a> brought it neatly to the forefront of my mind, our brief discussion on the fediverse giving me the kick to put some pen to paper.</p>
<hr>
<p>It&rsquo;s been clear to me for a while that the web as it stands is no longer tolerable to the human mind. Part of me has wondered if it&rsquo;s always been this way, if we&rsquo;ve had some kind of tolerance to it all that&rsquo;s been lost over time. But I don&rsquo;t believe that to be entirely the case. For some time now, there&rsquo;s been a major shift happening in the dynamic on the web: users are increasingly becoming a commodity rather than a community. Like all good things, the internet got ruined by people in suits. It&rsquo;s no longer about making you happy, but making you profitable.</p>
<p>Internet culture happens obscenely fast, so fast in fact that it makes it almost impossible to observe and recognise the changing landscape without something drastic and painful happening. Some companies have caught onto this, it&rsquo;s arguably the one thing Meta (aka. Facebook) has been doing successfully, not pissing off your user base. I&rsquo;ve always had an abnormal relationship with social media, no matter what I will always get overwhelmed and exhausted by a platform, however the ability for Instagram to get me to use it is terrifying.</p>
<p>I make an important distinction with social media platforms, mostly because I think the term &ldquo;social media&rdquo; is too broad. Social media for me covers platforms with media features, feed, video etc, outside of social communication. Social networks are those that do not feature visual content as the main focus. Another one worth mentioning is what I call &ldquo;social activity&rdquo;, platforms like <a href="https://futureland.tv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">futureland.tv</a> whose primary focus is an activity. Tracking habits, fitness etc, alongside social features which you can do these things independently alongside real people. Social activities have been a surprise hit for me, giving me motivation to track projects and habits in ways I never would have done on my own. I easily have the most healthy relationship with these than I do with any other social platform I&rsquo;ve ever used.</p>
<p>Being in my 20s, I come from a strange generation who didn&rsquo;t really grow up with technology properly. I think the experiences likely depend on your personal circumstances and upbringing, but those who I&rsquo;ve talked to share some similar notes.</p>
<p>Some of my earliest memories come from using the internet. I was very young, and my parents once or two let me play some flash games on a bbc website for kids. Back then we still had dial up, and the computer was housed in a big cabinet in the dining room. There hasn&rsquo;t been a desktop in the house for about 15 or 16 years now. As I grew up, how I interacted with the internet very quickly became largely influenced by others. I fell in love with club penguin as a social environment as a child, it was essentially a highly visual chat room for kids. Playing games and hanging out with friends was incredible, and the platform itself really understood children in a way that I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve really seen since. Almost everyone I know has fond memories of club penguin.</p>
<p>When I was 11, I was introduced to minecraft by a friend. Being a highly creative and inventive child, I couldn&rsquo;t have met a better match. I began playing around 2012, and would end up joining a server to play with my friend. But I kept playing on it alone, eventually finding a place where I could build creatively with other people in what would become a pivotal part of my life. For several years I played on this building server, and build up a big network of friends with people from all across the globe. If you&rsquo;re not familiar with the game, Minecraft&rsquo;s chat system is built very much like IRC visually, and it really allowed some great communication and collaboration in an age where voice chatting wasn&rsquo;t really the norm yet with strangers. I have fond memories of the time, and I learned so much about designing and being creative that I credit it with leading me to where I am today. No online experience for me has ever matched the sheer level of connection created by that environment, one which sadly doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore since that style of minecraft server is no longer popular.</p>
<p>My first true interactions with social media came from an early age. My mother signed me up to Facebook aged 8, with the intention that it would create social engagement for me, but unfortunately it just did not click with me. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve touched my account for more than 5 minutes since that day. I would only return to social media sever</p>
