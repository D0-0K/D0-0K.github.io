<div class="title"><h1 id="top">Year Review 2021</h1><hr></div>
<p>At a glance, this year has been a bit of a writeoff for me. I was diagnosed with Crohn&rsquo;s earlier in the year and I&rsquo;ve spent most of the rest recovering, going so far to drop out of college on medical leave. My high risk to covid has left me isolating in my home for a large amount of time as well. Both have hampered my ability to do much physical things, but allowed me to read and research more than I could before.</p>

<h2 id="favourite-things">Favourite things</h2><div class="text borderless box">

<div><h3 id="music">Music</h3><p><strong>∘ Favourite Artist - Mkgee</strong> - Most listened artist of the year for me, fantastic producer though his bandcamp is missing his latest album sadly.</p></div>

<div>
<h3 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h3><p><a href="https://fallofcivilizationspodcast.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">⬩ Fall of Civilisations podcast</a> - Fantastically engaging podcast that paints the fall of many civilisations in a concise, historical narrative.</p>
<p><a href="https://podcast.panic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">⬩ Panic Podcast</a> - A podcast about the portland software company, Panic. Incredibly fun and enjoyable listen!</p>

<div>
<h3 id="websites">Websites</h3><p><a href="https://100r.co/site/home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">⬩ Hundred Rabbits</a> - A site covering Rek and Devine&rsquo;s artist collective. I&rsquo;ve spent so many hours reading on this site, with so many adventures, knowledge and projects to read about, it really is a treasure trove.</p>
<p><a href="https://ritualdust.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">⬩ Ritual dust</a> - the personal site of Lizbeth Poirier, there&rsquo;s a wide range of content to be found on it.

<div>
<h3 id="youtube">Youtube</h3><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/DisruptReality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">⬩ Disrupt</a> - Disrupt&rsquo;s tv-imitation aids greatly to it&rsquo;s flowing narrative and visual style. The stories they cover are fascinating, and the videos themselves are incredibly well produced like nothing else I&rsquo;ve seen on the platform.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/NotJustBikes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">⬩ Not Just Bikes</a> - this channel has fast become a favourite on Hacker News, where I first came across it. The highly informative videos make you rethink the old, pedestrian-unfriendly infrastructure so many countries continue to use.</p>

<h2 id="going-forward">Going Forward</h2><p>The goal for 2022 is to get my health back into shape and sharpen my mind. I&rsquo;d like to focus my time learning to properly program in a way that will actually be useful to me. The first project of the new year will likely be a rebuilding of this site, I&rsquo;m unhappy hosting the site on github pages, not mention the code being an absolute mess. But I&rsquo;ve got a clear vision of what I want to do this time, which makes it a lot easier to plan for. After that I plan to dabble in some C for the Pebble and make some watchfaces for a challenge.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>This hasn&rsquo;t been the best year ever, but I&rsquo;m feeling more hopeful for next year! I&rsquo;ve still got several months of free time left on leave so I&rsquo;m eager to make the most of it. Here&rsquo;s to a happy new year!</p>
