      <description>Origami is the art of folding paper into various forms and objects. There are many different kinds of Origami other than traditional folding including modular designs like the Kusudamas, wet folding which allows creative sculpting, or even weaving with strip folding.
      The beautiful Origami Firework was the first design I ever made. Following a video tutorial, I struggled immensely to complete it but having no one to turn was an incredibly liberating experience as a teenager and the satisfaction of finishing it is something I still remember.</description>

      <description>Trichrome is a method of taking colour photography using different coloured filters (usually red, blue and green) to form a complete image. It was invented by Louis Ducos du Hauron in the late 19th century. It is most commonly used in black &amp;amp; white film photography to create atmospheric images, however the technique is usable with digital photography as well.
 How does it work?</description>

      <description>Beaches are filled with a vast number of different types of rocks and stones, but the ones that have always fascinated me are beach fossils. Fossil types can vary greatly based on your located, plants, shells and coral are all common types the can be found. Even chalk chunks are technically fossils!
 In my area, coral fossils are by far the most common. I&amp;rsquo;ve found ones of different shapes, sizes and quantities.</description>
